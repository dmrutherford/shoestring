[SHOESTRING](http://dmrutherford.github.io/shoestring/)
=======================================================

*Like Bootstrap, but without the baggage.  
Arguably also without the benefits.*


What's the Deal?
----------------

Shoestring is a stripped back template for a Jekyll- and Sass-powered website. It doesn't do much &ndash; hence the hilarious pun of a title. In reality it's more like [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) than [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap), but you know what they say: never pass up the opportunity for a bad joke.

They totally say that.


Caveats
-------

This is intended more for my own use than for anyone else's. People are very welcome to use it if it's useful, but be aware that it makes certain assumptions...

One major point is that compression is **not enabled** in `.htaccess`. This is definitely something you should enable if possible &ndash; however, I tend to host with [nearlyfreespeech.net](http://www.nearlyfreespeech.net), who don't offer it. Be aware.


Infrequently Asked Questions
----------------------------

*   **Does Shoestring include a fancy responsive grid?**

    No.

*   **Is Shoestring fully compatible across browsers, including older versions of IE?**

    Probably not. Look, if that kind of thing is an issue for you, you're not really part of the target audience here. Try [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com)?
    
*   **Will Shoestring play nice with Compass?**

    Maybe? I keep meaning to take a proper look at [Compass](http://compass-style.org), but I haven't got around to it yet.


Credit Where It's Due
---------------------

There are a whole bunch of basic frameworks out on the wild wild web that provided general inspiration. Code has been "borrowed" from H5BP and that old faithful, the [Meyer Reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).

In turn, you are more than welcome to use Shoestring in whole or in part. As ever, attribution welcomed but not required.
